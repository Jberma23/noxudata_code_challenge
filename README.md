## Instructions

The code can be view either by running `node server.mjs` followed by `npm run dev`. Additionally, you can see the component in storybook by running `npm run storybook`.

The design was changed very slightly as the figma design has a few issues like the "T" in segment being slightly cut off. So as close as I could get to the figma with some slight design changes.
